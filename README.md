This is the solution to this challenge prompt: https://github.com/avantcredit/programming_challenges/blob/master/line_of_credit_test

The CreditLine object is located inside the lib/line_of_credit.rb

The days are reset every 30 days. To simulate action use the "advance" function to make transaction on a different day. If given more time, we could refactor this with timecop to simulate the changing of days. 

There is no web page support for this object. Please import and run this object via interactive command line. Usage examples are found in spec/line_of_credit_spec.rb
